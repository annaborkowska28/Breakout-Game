Famous Breakout Game. The aim of the game is to bat the ball at the colored blocks until there are none left, while making sure the ball does not pass your paddle.
I also used an IDE, PyCharm. This is because it has a great project management system and is friendly to beginners (like me)! Besides Python, I used a Turtle module. Program was developed as an assignment for 100 days of code on Udemey.
